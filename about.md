---

I'm Sebastián — a technology and music enthusiast with over six years of hands-on experience through personal and academic projects. I specialize in Python programming, Linux server administration, web and mobile development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. I've built automated trading systems, explored ethical hacking, developed ERPs using Odoo, created web scrapers, chatbots, and desktop applications. I'm deeply interested in how emerging technologies disrupt and shape society, and I maintain a strong focus on innovation and self-directed learning.
